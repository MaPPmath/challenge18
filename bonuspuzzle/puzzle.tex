\phChapterWorksheet{Bonus Puzzle}{Catch Mobimon in the Expedition Zone!}

Take a trip through the \textbf{Expedition Zone} to catch as many Mobimon as you
can! Theres a catch, though: your path through the Expedition Zone has to follow
certain \textbf{path pieces.} Here are the rules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Two path pieces are adjacent if at least one square in one piece is
  orthogonally (\textbf{not diagonally}) adjacent to at least one square in the
  other piece.
\item You must have a path piece adjacent to the \textbf{starting line}.
\item You must have a path piece adjacent to the \textbf{finish line}.
\item You may not have any breaks in your path. It must be an \textbf{unbroken
    path} of adjacent pieces from start to finish.
\item Your path may cross itself.
\end{enumerate}

You may notice several Mobimon inhabiting the Expedition Zone! These Mobimon are
represented by \textbf{numbers,} and each number is its \textbf{strength.} To
catch a Mobimon, you must

\begin{enumerate}
\item make sure your path goes over that Mobimon, and
\item a piece on that Mobimon must have \textbf{more squares than that Mobimon's
  strength}.
\end{enumerate}

Your score is the \textbf{sum of the strengths of the Mobimon you catch}. The
teams with the two highest scores get \textbf{Victory Points}! Good luck!
