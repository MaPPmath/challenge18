\phChapterWorksheet{The Expedition Zone}{Bonus Puzzle}

The \textbf{Expedition Zone}, found off the side of
Road \(6+i^2\), is a great place to catch some rare \mappMobimon{}!
You've been provided elevent \textbf{Mob\'i Nets}
to set up in the Zone. There are a few rules to consider, however.

\begin{enumerate}
\item You may set up your nets in any order, but your first net must cover
      the \textbf{upper left corner} of the Zone.
\item All subsequent nets \textbf{must be connected at a corner}
      to a previous net, as in this example.

\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[fill=black!10] (0,0) grid (1,1) rectangle (0,0);
    \draw[fill=black!30] (1,1) grid (2,3) rectangle (1,1);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

\item Nets \textbf{cannot connect along an edge} to other nets,
      as in this example.


\begin{center}
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[fill=black!10] (0,0) grid (1,1) rectangle (0,0);
    \draw[fill=black!30] (1,0) grid (2,2) rectangle (1,0);
  \end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\end{enumerate}

You've been provided with an \textbf{Expedition Zone Map}. Each square
on this map that contains a number represents a \mappMobimon{} with
that much strength.
\textbf{Maximize the sum of the numbers covered by your Nets},
and you'll prove you have what it takes to become a \mappMobimon{} Champion!
