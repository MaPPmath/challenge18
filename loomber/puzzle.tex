\phChapterWorksheet{Cryptic Puzzle ?}{Timber!}

The Plant-Type Dojo leader has challenged your party against his
best \mappMobimon{}: Loombar.

``It seems you've never faced a \mappMobimon{} like Loombar before!
It's as sturdy as a hundred-year-old tree... unless you're able to
strike its \textbf{ten secret weak points} in order,
you'll never knock it down!''

Lucky for you, you didn't leave home without your trusty Player's Guide.
