\phChapterWorksheet{Civic Duty}{Cryptic Puzzle 1}

You finally slip away from the rambling Tutorial Man, but just your luck!
A pack of \mappMobimon{} are blocking the path
through Road \(\ln(148.45)\)!

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
  \item {Dankgunk}
  \item {Burnie}
  \item {Glooble}
  \item {Electrumble}
  \item {Corporil}
  \item {Ayepey}
  \item {Hearit}
  \item {Forluxi}
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

Luckily, the nearby \mappMobimon{} Center has 86 trainers on staff,
because they need \textbf{all of them} to get them back in control.

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Glooble needs the fewest trainers.
\item Corporil needs the most trainers.
\item Electrumble and Hearit are the only pair that require
      the same number of tamers.
\item The number of trainers needed by Dankgunk and Glooble differ by one.
\item The number of trainers needed by Dankgunk and Electrumble differ by one,
      and add to nine.
\item Ayepey, Burnie, Corporil, and Forluxi each need at least ten
      trainers.
\item Ayepey needs a perfect square number of trainers.
\item Ayepey, Burnie, and Forluxi each need an even number of trainers.
\item Ayepey and Burnie's required trainer numbers share a prime factor.
\item Burnie and Corporil's required trainer numbers share a prime factor.
\item Corporil and Forluxi's required trainer numbers share a prime factor.
\item But Corporil and Ayepey's required trainer numbers do not
      share a prime factor.
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

You start to offer your help, but are quickly rebuffed by the \mappMobimon{}
Center's leader, a famous \textbf{Dojo Master}! ``Hang on, young trainer!
I'm afraid there's yet a certain \textbf{quality} you need to learn before
you get yourself hurt.'' You're not sure what she means, but figure that
the best way to find out is to start by calculating
how many trainers each \mappMobimon{} requires.
