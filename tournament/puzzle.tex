You've finally reached the end of your journey, having been honored
by the four \textbf{Dojo Masters} with the opportunity to compete with them
and three other trainers in the \textbf{\mappMobimon{} Tournament}! You've
each been ranked according to your previous battle experience; unfortunately,
that means you'll have to work your way up from the bottom!

Your task is no simple one, so be sure to read over the
\textbf{\mappMobimon{} Battling Overview} to learn the ins and outs
of the tournament.

\begin{itemize}
  \item You should be able to \textbf{figure out which \mappMobimon{}} each of
        the Dojo Masters will use in this tournament
        based upon your previous experiences with them and the provided
        \textbf{\mappMobimon{} List}.
  \item You'll also need to \textbf{choose a \mappMobimon{} for yourself}.
        Luckily, there's exactly one \mappMobimon{} on the provided list that
        can beat every trainer you'll face in the tournament!
  \item Finally, if you \textbf{rank the participating \mappMobimon{}} according
        to the tournament results, you might be able to identify a common
        nickname for the \mappMobimon{} Champion, solving today's final
        puzzle!

\phWorksheet{\mappMobimon{} Battling Overview}

The \(PWR\) of a \mappMobimon{} move is equal to the
\mappMobimon{}'s \(LV\), but modified by a couple rules.

Each \mappMobimon{} has one or two of these types: Ordinary, Flame, Aqua, Plant,
Magic, Undead, and Lightning. In addition, each \mappMobimon{} move has one
of those types as well. If the type of the move matches one of its user's
types, then the \(PWR\) of that move is multiplied by \(1.5\). Otherwise
the \mappMobimon{} type does not affect the \(PWR\) of the move at all.

Secondly, the type(s) of the opponent \mappMobimon{} also affect the move's
\(PWR\), according to the following chart.
For each of the opponent's type(s), take the cell found in the
intersection of that column and the row given by the move type. If the cell
isn't empty, multiply the move's \(PWR\) by that number.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
     &  O  &  F  &  A  &  P  &  M  &  U  &  L  \\\hline\hline
  O  &     &     &     &     & 1/2 &  0  & 1/2 \\\hline
  F  &     & 1/2 & 1/2 &  2  &     &  2  &     \\\hline
  A  &     &  2  & 1/2 & 1/2 &  2  &     &     \\\hline
  P  &     & 1/2 &  2  & 1/2 &     &     &  2  \\\hline
  M  & 1/2 &  2  &     &     &     &     &  2  \\\hline
  U  &  0  &     &     &  2  &  2  &     &     \\\hline
  L  & 1/2 &     &  2  &     &     &  2  &     \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

For example, a Flame-type move used against a Plant/Magic-type
\mappMobimon{} is modified by a factor of \(2\), but it
would be modified by \(\frac{1}{4}\) if used against a Flame/Aqua-type
\mappMobimon{}. (If the user has the Flame type, then the modifers would
actually be \(3\) and \(\frac{3}{8}\), respectively.)

Each \mappMobimon{} knows two different moves, so it's up to the
trainer to decide which move would have greater \(PWR\) against their
opponent. The \mappMobimon{} that uses the move with greater \(PWR\) than
their opponent wins the battle and moves on in the tournament, and the
loser is knocked out.

During a tournament, each trainer must use the same \mappMobimon{} for all
battles. At the conclusion of the tournament, the trainers and their
\mappMobimon{} are ranked according
to how many battles were won: 1st place for 3 wins, 2nd place for 2 wins,
3rd-4th place for 1 win, and 5th-8th place for no wins. The rankings each
trainer entered the tournament with are used to sort 3rd-4th and 5th-8th
places.
