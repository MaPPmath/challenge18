\phChapterWorksheet{The Nickname Rater}{Main Puzzle 3}
% https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MU_puzzle

As your adventure continues, you find yourself in
\textbf{Achromatopsia City}, located at the end of Road \(20.7183-e\)
and home of the famous \mappMobidash{} \textbf{Nickname Rater}.
She explains that while Trainers often like to give their
\mappMobidot{} cute nicknames, she's very particular about the rules
for an \textbf{excellent} \mappMobidash{} nickname.
For clarity, you can assume
that a \textbf{vowel} is any of the letters \texttt{A/E/I/O/U}, and a
\textbf{consonant} is any other English letter.

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Rule 0:}
        \texttt{A} is an excellent nickname.
  \item \textbf{Rule 1:}
        Adding a consonant to the end of an excellent nickname ending with
        a vowel creates a new excellent nickname.
  \item \textbf{Rule 2:}
        Doubling an excellent nickname creates a new excellent nickname.
  \item \textbf{Rule 3:}
        Replacing three consecutive vowels in an excellent nickname with
        a consonant creates a new excellent nickname.
  \item \textbf{Rule 4:}
        Removing two consecutive consonants from an excellent nickname
        creates a new excellent nickname.
  \item \textbf{Rule 5:}
        Exchanging the consonants in an excellent nickname with other
        consonants creates a new excellent nickname. Similarly,
        exchanging the vowels in an excellent nickname with other vowels
        creates a new excellent nickname.
  \item Nicknames that cannot be created using these rules are not
        excellent.
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

For example, \texttt{A} (Rule 0), \texttt{AA} (Rule 2), \texttt{AAAA} (Rule 2),
\texttt{SA} (Rule 3), \texttt{SAM} (Rule 1), \texttt{SAMSAM} (Rule 2),
\texttt{SAAM} (Rule 4), and \texttt{NEAT} (Rule 5) are all excellent nicknames.

The Nickname Rater, not one to shy away from a good \textbf{puzzle}, offers you
the chance to rate the following \mappMobidot{} nicknames yourself.  You'll know
when you've done it correctly, because if you \textbf{take the first letters of
the excellent nicknames below} in order, you will spell a good
\textbf{seven-letter word for a nickname}
(even if it's not particularly \textbf{excellent} itself).

% note: excellent nicknames cannot have 0(mod3) vowels
