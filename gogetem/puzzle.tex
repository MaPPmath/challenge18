While catching \mappMobimon{} on \textbf{Road 2,} you run across a wise old
\mappMobimon{} trainer who challenges you to a \mappMobimon{} battle. But not
just any \mappMobimon{} battle! This is a \textbf{puzzle battle.} The reward?
The location where all the \mappMobimon{} gather.

The old man tells you about a game he enjoyed in his youth called \textbf{Go.}

Go is a game of strategy played with black and white pieces on a grid. It's a
bit like chess, except instead of lots of kinds of pieces, each player only has
\textbf{one kind of piece, the stone.} And instead of playing on the squares,
players play on the \textbf{intersections of the grid lines.} And \textbf{black
  goes first.} Maybe it's not all that much like chess.
