Welcome to the world of \textbf{Mobile Monsters}, or \textbf{\mappMobimon}
for short! Not to be confused with the similarly named video game series loved
by fans the world over, \mappMobimon{} is a \textit{completely original} concept
where Trainers befriend monsters and use them to battle opponents. (Cough.)

Under the guidance of your mentor, \textbf{Dr. Treename}, you will soon set off
on your adventure to befriend the \mappMobimon{} of the \textbf{Kantor region}.
You'll meet many strange characters, but if you can solve their problems
they just might lead you to the location of the \textbf{Dojo Masters}.
By earning their respect, you'll be allowed to enter the
\textbf{\mappMobimon{} Tournament} for the chance to be crowned
\textbf{\mappMobimon{} Champion}! Maybe you'll even discover the location
of the Legendary \mappMobimon{} \(\mu\)Too?...

As you might expect, most of the challenges you'll face today won't actually
be combat related. In the world of \mappMobimon{}, nothing is more important
than your \textbf{problem-solving abilities}. So sharpen your minds and
pencils, because you never know when a wild \textbf{puzzle} will appear!
