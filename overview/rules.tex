\phSection{Opening Puzzle}

Today's first puzzle is something of a
\textit{tour de force}! You'll want to solve this
opening challenge as quickly as possible to earn
\textbf{up to 10 Victory Points} and collect today's five Main Puzzles.
Every minute will count, trust us!

\phSection{Main Puzzles}

Each Main Puzzle solves to a hidden word or phrase. You'll need to work
with your teammates to discover the mathematics at work and uncover each
solution! Once you think you've found it, report your solution to Game Control
for \textbf{15 Victory Points}!

\phSection{Bonus Puzzles}

Another reward for solving each Main Puzzle is its matching Bonus Puzzle.
These challenges are optimization-based, so you'll want to refine your answers
throughout the game. You may \textbf{submit} a solution to Game Control
\textbf{up to two times}.
GC will immediately grade your response to confirm your submission, and
the best of both submissions will be used to rank your team against your
opponents.

At the end of the game, the top team for each Bonus Puzzle
will earn \textbf{10 Victory Points},
and the runner-up team will earn \textbf{5 Victory Points}.

\phSection{Metapuzzle}

You'll receive a copy of the Metapuzzle along with the five Main Puzzles.
However, you won't get far with that alone! There are five more
pieces to the Metapuzzle available, and your team will receive one for
every Main Puzzle you solve.

This Metapuzzle is all about optimization, just like the Bonus
Puzzles, and like the Bonuses you will be allowed \textbf{two attempts}.
At the end of the game, the top team for the Metapuzzle
will earn \textbf{10 Victory Points},
and the runner-up team will earn \textbf{5 Victory Points}.
respectively.

\phSection{Another Puzzle?}

You never know at a MaPP event! If you think you've found the solution to
a hidden puzzle, come find us at Game Control. Such a puzzle solution would
be worth \textbf{15 Victory Points}...

\phSection{Endgame}

All solutions are due at Game Control at 4:15pm;
players not in line at GC to submit a solution at that time will be turned away.

\phSection{Winning the Game}

The team that has earned the \textbf{most Victory Points} by the end of the
competition is the \textbf{winner}. If two teams are tied,
then the team that submitted their final Main Puzzle solution
earlier will be ranked higher.
